# Modern, interoperable data center

Weâ€™re excited to announce the series of webinars on the modern, interoperable data center.

## Part 1 - Solving last mile problems with BGP

This webinar will guide you through a solution for DC connectivity based on a combination of FRR, Unnumbered BGP (IPv4 with IPv6 link-local NH) and eBPF. This mix produces an automated discovery of bare metal and XaaS environments and can be run on any COTS as it uses only open-source and standardized features.

In this webinar, we will will explain:

1. The evolution of the data center and its impact on the last mile for operations
2. How to handle 1the growing number of devices and configurations needed
3. How to create a proper automated discovery in a data center using:

    - Unnumbered BGP (IPv4 with IPv6 link-local NH)
    - Free Range Routing
    - eBPF

4. The type of issues will you encounter and how to overcome them

*Stay tuned for the next webinars in this series!*

## Part 2 - EVPN as a universal solution for VM, container and BMS networking

## Part 3 - Seamless and secure connectivity for edge computing and hybrid clouds

This GitHub repository stores all the files and configurations mentioned during the webinars.
